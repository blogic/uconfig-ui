# Theming
The project using TailwindCSS makes it very easy to theme the project.

The current project theme is located in the **tailwind.config.js** file.

Default color names from Tailwind were removed in favor of generic names like "primary", "secondary", "warning", "danger" to allow easy theming.

You can visit this [page]([https://react.i18next.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme)https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) to look into further theming the app.
